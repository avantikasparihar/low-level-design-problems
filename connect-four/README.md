### Problem Statement:
Build the object-oriented design for a two-player Connect Four game. Players take turns dropping discs into a 7-column, 6-row board. The first to align four of their own discs vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

### Requirements:

1. Player specifies column no and then ball automatically drops to the lowest row.
2. The game ends if any of the player aligns 4 balls in a row- horizontal, vertical or diagonal; it draws if the board gets full.
3. System supports only 1 game to be played at a time.
4. History of moves and undo functionality is not required.
5. Size of the board is always 7x6.
